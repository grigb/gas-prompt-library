I'm rewinding to this checkpoint before compaction. The conversation log/term captured, and pasted below this prompt, is work that already happened after this point (you don't remember it). 

**Important:** The filesystem already reflects the work in the log. Files were edited, created, or deleted during that work and those changes persist. Your memory is at the checkpoint, but the files are at end-of-log state.

**Before reading the log:** Briefly note what you remember right now (what you were working on, any pending questions, context you're holding).

**Then:** Read the log as completed history, flag anything truncated near the end, and produce a concise handoff for a new agent covering: objective, completed work, current state, next steps, and warnings about incomplete work.

**If user told you directly that context was low:** Keep your response brief.

**HANDOFF INSTRUCTIONS**
After you've understood the context added in the log below and what progress may have been made that you need to convey, please follow the handoff instructions here: ~/.agents/prompts/handoffs/HANDOFF.md

**LOG STARTS IMMEDIATELY BELOW THIS LINE**
