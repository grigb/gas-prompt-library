# Subtask Pre-Work Report

**MANDATORY: Write this report BEFORE making any changes.**

## Purpose

Forces you to reason through the work before acting. Creates audit trail for recovery if something fails.

## Report Format

Write to your output file FIRST:

```markdown
## Pre-Work Report

**Task:** [What you are doing - one sentence]

**Why:** [What problem this solves, why it matters]

**How:**
- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Files to modify]
- [Methods/patterns to use]

**Testable Results:**
- [ ] [Specific verification 1]
- [ ] [Specific verification 2]
- [ ] [Command to run that proves success]
```

## Then Proceed

Only after completing this report:
1. Implement the work
2. Run your testable results
3. Update the report with actual outcomes

## Why This Matters

- Prevents "just start coding" mistakes
- If you fail mid-task, the report helps the next agent understand what you intended
- Creates accountability - you committed to specific testable results
- Orchestrator can use this to diagnose failures and plan recovery
