Read AGENTS.md for context. Then read PROJECT-RULES.md for onboarding. Then execute the following.

Context:
K2B provenance-audit repair for LAN is already completed by Codex authority. Do not repeat K2B audit repair work in this run.

Authority artifacts:
- /Users/grig/work/lan/lan-platform/.dev/ai/reports/k2b-provenance-audits/2026-02-19-05-00-58-lan-platform-k2b-provenance-audit.md
- /Users/grig/work/lan/lan-platform/.dev/ai/reports/k2b-provenance-audits/REPORT-INDEX.md
- /Users/grig/.agents/.dev/ai/handoffs/k2b-agent-guidance/2026-02-19-k2b-guidance-lan-platform.md

Execution objective:
Return to LAN critical-path delivery under interface-first rules.

Required sequencing:
1. Resume `WO-lan-screen-onboarding-canvas`
2. Resume `WO-lan-ember-gallery-navigation`
3. Resume `WO-lan-tv-native-player-app-kiosk-mode`
4. Keep Group B backend execution on hold until Foundation Gate is explicitly opened.

Scope guardrails:
- Do not run K2B modernization or provenance repair tasks unless explicitly requested.
- Use K2B gap list only as a non-blocking reference.
- Prioritize deliverable movement on Group A work orders.

Mandatory output file:
- /Users/grig/work/lan/lan-platform/.dev/ai/reports/2026-02-19-interface-first-critical-path-resume.md

Report must contain:
- work order resumed first and rationale
- status snapshot for all Group A WOs
- blockers and required decisions
- files changed in this run
- exact next 3 executable shell commands

Final chat response format:
- Project root
- Resumed WO
- Files updated
- Blockers
- Exact next 3 commands
